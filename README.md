# Spacedrift
Spacedrift is a thrilling arcade game built using C++ and the graphics.h library. The player controls a spaceship, firing at violet aliens to score points. The game features sound effects and music for an immersive experience. The player inputs a username, and their score is saved. Every 5 points, the level increases, and the aliens' speed increases. The game can be paused with 'P' and exited with 'ESC'. A "Wall of Game" displays the top 5 high scores and usernames, and the "Reviews" option stores and displays reviews in a text file. The game utilizes coordinate manipulation, file storage for scores and reviews, and the sound function. Spacedrift is a fun and engaging game that showcases the use of C++ and graphics.h.
